# Python Executables
Okkay, so back to game and algorithms. But what is the fun when you can't show your projects. Well, of course you can, but they must have python installed which is not a hard thing. But most don't have it installed, nor know how to run python files.
But what about **Executables** ?. Most of the people who use personal computers know how to install an .exe file.
So I converted some of my python projects into .exe files usind **pyinstaller** module. These executables do not need python to be installed on a computer to run. And it's easy to share I guess.
So, I present to you some projects --
1. Heart:
 * A simple Turtle project that draws a heart and write something in the middle. It's up to you to find out what that writing it.
 * If you close the file before it ends srawing, it will pop an error up and crash. Just ignore it. That's my fault that I didn't change the code properly before converting it into an executable.
2. CoPrime:
 * Co-Prime, as the name suggests, is a math related project. It shows how many numbers are co-prime to a number that you input. Also known as Euler's Totient Function Ï•(n).
 * Upon booting up the .exe file, a window pops up asking you to input a number. After you input a number, another window pops up saying some things. Again, it's up to you to find out.
 * However, if you input negative number or a non-integer (float, string etc) you will end up crashing the app. Again, this is my fault. In shaa allah these will be fixed.
